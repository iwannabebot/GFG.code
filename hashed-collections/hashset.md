## HashSet

### HashSet in C#
A <code>HashSet<T></code> is an unordered collection of the unique elements. It comes under System.Collections.Generic namespace. It is used in a situation where we want to prevent duplicates from being inserted in the collection. As far as performance is concerned, it is better in comparison to the list.

#### Characteristics of HashSet Class:

The <code>HashSet<T></code> class provides high-performance set operations. A set is a collection that contains no duplicate elements, and whose elements are in no particular order.
The capacity of a <code>HashSet<T></code> object is the number of elements that the object can hold.
A <code>HashSet<T></code> objectâ€™s capacity automatically increases as elements are added to the object.
A <code>HashSet<T></code> collection is not sorted and cannot contain duplicate elements.
<code>HashSet<T></code> provides many mathematical set operations, such as set addition (unions) and set subtraction.

|METHOD|DESCRIPTION|
|---|---|
|<code>Add(T)<code>|Adds the specified element to a set.|
|<code>Clear()<code>|Removes all elements from a HashSet object.|
|<code>Contains(T)<code>|Determines whether a HashSet object contains the specified element.|
|<code>CopyTo()<code>|Copies the elements of a HashSet collection to an array.|
|<code>CreateSetComparer()<code>|Returns an IEqualityComparer object that can be used for equality testing of a HashSet object.|
|<code>Equals(Object)<code>|Determines whether the specified object is equal to the current object.|
|<code>ExceptWith(IEnumerable)<code>|Removes all elements in the specified collection from the current HashSet object.|
|<code>GetEnumerator()<code>|Returns an enumerator that iterates through a HashSet object.|
|<code>GetHashCode()<code>|Serves as the default hash function.|
|<code>GetObjectData(SerializationInfo, StreamingContext)<code>|Implements the ISerializable interface and returns the data needed to serialize a HashSet object.|
|<code>GetType()<code>|Gets the Type of the current instance.|
|<code>IntersectWith(IEnumerable)<code>|Modifies the current HashSet object to contain only elements that are present in that object and in the specified collection.|
|<code>IsProperSubsetOf(IEnumerable)<code>|Determines whether a HashSet object is a proper subset of the specified collection.|
|<code>IsProperSupersetOf(IEnumerable)<code>|Determines whether a HashSet object is a proper superset of the specified collection.|
|<code>IsSubsetOf(IEnumerable)<code>|Determines whether a HashSet object is a subset of the specified collection.|
|<code>IsSupersetOf(IEnumerable)<code>|Determines whether a HashSet object is a superset of the specified collection.|
|<code>MemberwiseClone()<code>|Creates a shallow copy of the current Object.|
|<code>OnDeserialization(Object)<code>|Implements the ISerializable interface and raises the deserialization event when the deserialization is complete.|
|<code>Overlaps(IEnumerable)<code>|Determines whether the current HashSet object and a specified collection share common elements.|
|<code>Remove(T)<code>|Removes the specified element from a HashSet object.|
|<code>RemoveWhere(Predicate)<code>|Removes all elements that match the conditions defined by the specified predicate from a HashSet collection.|
|<code>SetEquals(IEnumerable)<code>|Determines whether a HashSet object and the specified collection contain the same elements.|
|<code>SymmetricExceptWith(IEnumerable)<code>|Modifies the current HashSet object to contain only elements that are present either in that object or in the specified collection, but not both.|
|<code>ToString()<code>|Returns a string that represents the current object.|
|<code>TrimExcess()<code>|Sets the capacity of a HashSet object to the actual number of elements it contains, rounded up to a nearby, implementation-specific value.|
|<code>TryGetValue(T, T)<code>|Searches the set for a given value and returns the equal value it finds, if any.|
|<code>UnionWith(IEnumerable)<code>|Modifies the current HashSet object to contain all elements that are present in itself, the specified collection, or both.|

### HashSet in Java

The HashSet class implements the Set interface, backed by a hash table which is actually a HashMap instance. No guarantee is made as to the iteration order of the set which means that the class does not guarantee the constant order of elements over time. This class permits the null element. The class also offers constant time performance for the basic operations like add, remove, contains and size assuming the hash function disperses the elements properly among the buckets, which we shall see further in the article.

#### Characteristics of HashSet Class:

Few important features of HashSet are:

1. Implements Set Interface.
2. Underlying data structure for HashSet is hashtable.
3. As it implements the Set Interface, duplicate values are not allowed.
4. Objects that you insert in HashSet are not guaranteed to be inserted in same order. Objects are inserted based on their hash code.
5. NULL elements are allowed in HashSet.
6. HashSet also implements Searlizable and Cloneable interfaces.

|METHOD|DESCRIPTION|
|---|---|
|<code>boolean add(E e)<code>|Used to add the specified element if it is not present, if it is present then return false.|
|<code>void clear()<code>|Used to remove all the elements from set.|
|<code>boolean contains(Object o)<code>|Used to return true if an element is present in set.|
|<code>boolean remove(Object o)<code>|Used to remove the element if it is present in set.|
|<code>Iterator iterator()<code>|Used to return an iterator over the element in the set.|
|<code>boolean isEmpty()<code>|Used to check whether the set is empty or not. Returns true for empty and false for non-empty condition for set.|
|<code>int size()<code>|Used to return the size of the set.|
|<code>Object clone()<code>|Used to create a shallow copy of the set.|
